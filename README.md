# Seat Allocator System

## 📌 Overview
Seat Allocator is an automated system designed to assign examination seats to students efficiently and fairly. It eliminates manual seat planning by using structured logic to allocate seats based on available exam halls and student data.

This project was developed as part of a **hackathon**, focusing on real-world academic examination challenges.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate the exam seat allocation process  
- Reduce human errors in manual seating plans  
- Ensure fair and conflict-free seat distribution  
- Save time for academic administrators  

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement
Manual seat allocation during examinations is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to manage for large numbers of students. The Seat Allocator system addresses this issue by generating a systematic seating arrangement automatically.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Student data-based seat assignment  
- Handles multiple exam halls and seat capacities  
- Prevents duplicate or conflicting seat allocation  
- Fast and scalable for large datasets  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend / Logic:** Python  
- **Data Handling:** CSV / Database (as applicable)  
- **Algorithm:** Rule-based seat distribution  

*(Tech stack can be customized or extended)*

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Input student details (roll number, course, subject, etc.)
2. Input exam hall details (room number, total seats)
3. System processes data using allocation logic
4. Final seating plan is generated automatically
